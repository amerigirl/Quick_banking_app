# Quick_banking_app

You can find a video link to this really easy and quick baning app here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQbEH4tVMJA&t=1010s
What I liked most about this was the skills it helped me to review as a new coder.  It reminded me of how simple structure can be created with just the sout(println).  

## You can be super creative here!

I changed so much of this project to make it my own, while keeping the basic structure of the app itself!  Have fun with this app, watch the video, and do somehting cool with it :)
